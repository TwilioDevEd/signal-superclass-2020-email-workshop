You will also find links to the Twilio SendGrid helper libraries, documentation, and other resources that will help you quickly send your own email.

## Workshop Description

Email is an essential part of most applications. Whether you need to send order confirmations, password resets, or policy updates, integrating email is a must. Twilio SendGrid’s APIs make it easy to programmatically deliver messages at scale.

In this workshop, you’ll learn how to:

1. Send an email with the Mail Send API
2. Create a template with the Design and Code Editor
3. Add dynamic data to a template with Handlebars
4. Properly configure Domain Authentication to ensure your messages reach the inbox
